    <h1>Instructor Terms</h1>
    <h4>1. Instructor Obligations</h4>
    <p>As an instructor, you are responsible for all content that you post, including lectures, quizzes, coding exercises, practice tests, assignments, resources, answers, course landing page content, and announcements ("Submitted Content"). </p>
    <h4>2. License to Udemy</h4>
    <p> You grant Udemy the rights detailed in the Terms of Use to offer, market, and otherwise exploit your Submitted Content, and to sublicense it to students for these purposes directly or through third parties. This includes the right to add captions or otherwise modify content to ensure accessibility.

        Unless otherwise agreed (including within our Promotions Policy), you have the right to remove all or any portion of your Submitted Content from the Services at any time. Except as otherwise agreed, Udemy's right to sublicense the rights in this section will terminate with respect to new users 60 days after the Submitted Content's removal. However, (1) rights given to students before the Submitted Content's removal will continue in accordance with the terms of those licenses (including any grants of lifetime access) and (2) Udemy's right to use such Submitted Content for marketing purposes shall survive termination.
        
        We may record all or any part of your Submitted Content for quality control and for delivering, marketing, promoting, demonstrating, or operating the Services. You grant Udemy permission to use your name, likeness, voice, and image in connection with offering, delivering, marketing, promoting, demonstrating, and selling the Services, your Submitted Content, or Udemy's content, and you waive any rights of privacy, publicity, or other rights of a similar nature, to the extent permissible under applicable law. </p>
